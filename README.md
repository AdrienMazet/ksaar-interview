Code this function in js or ts, put it in your github and share link

take care of best practices, code quality, write a function described by the following specifications:

given an array of positive and negative integers, it returns the closest
number to zero

if the closest number in input could be either negative or positive,
the function returns the positive one

if the input array is undefined or empty, the function returns 0

## How to run it ?

`node index.js`

You should see true logged multiple times (test for the function)

## With more time I would have ...

- Added Typescript to type the parameter of my function `numbers: number[]`

- Added jest as a test runner to use assertions, organize my tests, and have a better feedback

- Extracted if checks in other function if the logic was a bit more complicated
